  <b>Prep Time: </b> 15 minutes | <b>Cook Time: </b> | 30 minutes | <b>Total Time: </b> | 45 minutes | Calories: 531 kcal |

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<li> 1 lb. Ziti Pasta
<li> 1 Jar of Rao's Marinara Sauce
<li> 2 Cup of Kraft Italian Five Cheese Blend
<li> 1/2 Cup of Kraft Shredded Parmesan Cheese
<li> 1 Cup of Kraft Mozzarella Cheese

<h4>For Alfredo Sauce</h4>
<li>3 tbsp butter
<li>3 tbsp flour
<li>1 1/2 tsp minced garlic
<li>2 cups milk
<li>1 cup Kraft Parmesan Cheese
<li>1 1/2 tsp garlic powder *Or to taste*
<li>Salt and pepper to taste

<ol><h3>Instructions</h3>
<li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 9 x 13 baking dish.
<li>Cook your pasta according to the package but leave it a little under-done, so it is not too soft. It will soften and cook a bit more in the oven.
When the pasta is cooked just under-done, drain it, and rinse it in cold water so it stops cooking. Set it aside.
</ol>

<ol><h4> For Alfredo Sauce</h4>
<li>Melt your butter in a skillet over medium heat and add flour and minced garlic. Whisk it together and let it cook for 1-2 minutes until the garlic becomes fragrant and the butter and flour bubble.
<li>Add your milk to the butter and flour and whisk it together until mixed well. Continue to whisk the sauce over medium heat until it starts to thicken.
<li>Add your milk, parmesan cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Then stir until the sauce is thick and smooth.
</ol>

<ol><h4>Making the Pasta Dish</h4>
<li>Pour the pasta in a greased 9×13 baking dish.
<li>Mix the Alfredo and Marinara Sauce. You can adjust the seasonings at this point as well if you need to. You can add more garlic powder, salt etc.
<li>Pour Sauce on the cooked pasta. Mix well.
<li>Take half of your grated mozzarella cheese and mix in the pasta and sauce.
<li>Cover baking dish with foil.
<li>Bake at 375° for 30 minutes. Take the foil off the last 10	
</ol>
Congratulations! You've just made the best Ziti Pasta bake to ever exist.
