<h2><center>Kendall's Bake Ziti Pasta</center></h2>

<h3> Description </h3>
  A delicious baked ziti with italian sausage, and multiple cheeses. <br>
  This is my mom's recipe! <br>
  <b>Prep Time: </b> 15 minutes | <b>Cook Time: </b> | 30 minutes | <b>Total Time: </b> | 45 minutes

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<li> 1 lb. Ziti Pasta
<li> 1-2 Jars of Rao's Marinara Sauce
<li> 2 Cup Kraft Italian Five Cheese Blend

<h4>For Alfredo Sauce</h4>
<li>3 tbsp butter
<li>3 tbsp flour
<li>1 1/2 tsp minced garlic
<li>2 cups milk
<li>1 cup Kraft Parmesan Cheese
<li>1 1/2 tsp garlic powder *Or to taste*
<li>Salt and pepper to taste

<ol><h3>Intructions</h3>
<li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 9 x 13 baking dish.
<li>Cook your pasta according to the package but leave it a little under-done, so it is not too soft. It will soften and cook a bit more in the oven.
When the pasta is cooked just under-done, drain it, and rinse it in cold water so it stops cooking. Set it aside.
</ol>

<ol><h4> For Alfredo Sauce</h4>
<li>Melt your butter in a skillet over medium heat and add your flour and minced garlic. Whisk it together and let it cook for 1-2 minutes until the garlic becomes fragrant and butter and flour start to bubble.
<li>Add your milk to the butter and flour and whisk it together until mixed well. Continue to whisk the sauce over medium heat until it starts to thicken.
<li>Add your cream cheese and whisk until the cream cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.
</ol>

<ol><h4>Making the Pasta Dish</h4>
<li>Mix the Alfredo and Marinara Sauce together. You can adjust the seasonings at this point as well if needed. You can add more garlic powder, salt etc.
<li>Mix in the cooked pasta. Mix well.
<li>Take half of your grated mozzarella cheese (about 1 cup) and mix in the pasta and sauce.*If you are adding cooked meat or veggies in the dish, add it now!
<li>Pour the pasta in a greased 9×13 baking dish. Cover with foil.
<li>Bake at 375° for 30 minutes. Take the foil off the last 10	
</ol>
